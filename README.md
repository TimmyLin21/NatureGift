### What I learned

Playsinline attribute in <video> tag allows the mobile browser play the video right where it is instead of opening it up with fullscreen. 
```html
<video class="w-100" autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="../assets/video/fresh-and-delicious.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```
Add the horizontal lines besides header with flexbox. 
```html
<h2 class="mb-4 text-secondary d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center">
  <b class="d-block h-2 bg-primary flex-grow-1"></b>
  <span class="mx-4">See why customers love our products</span>
  <b class="d-block h-2 bg-primary flex-grow-1"></b>
</h2>
```


### Continued development

I still need more practice to get used to Vue. Besides, there are still room to improve for accessibility of this project, hope to get more familiar with them in the future project.
